    // for
    // We use for loop when we know how many iteration we go. Let's see the following example
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(`For: ${i}`)
    }

    // while
    // We use the while loop when we do not know how man iteration we go in advance
    let whileCount = 4
    while (whileCount >= 0) {
        console.log(`While: ${whileCount}`)
        whileCount--
    }

    // do while
    let doWhileCount = 0
    do {
        console.log(`Do while: ${doWhileCount}`)
        doWhileCount++
    } while (doWhileCount < 5)

    // for of
    // The for of loop is very handy to use it with array.
    // If we are not interested in the index of the array a for of loop is preferable to regular for loop or forEach loop
    const forOfNumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    for (const number of forOfNumbers) {
        console.log(`For of: ${number}`)
    }

    // for each
    // If we are interested in the index of the array forEach is preferable to for of loop.
    // The forEach array method takes a callback function,
    //  the callback function takes three arguments: the item, the index and the array itself.
    const forEachNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    forEachNumbers.forEach((number, index, array) => {
        console.log(`Foreach => index: ${index}, number: ${number}`)
    })

    // for in
    // The for in loop can be used with object literals to get the keys of the object
    const user = {
        firstName: 'Jesus',
        lastName: 'Valera',
        age: 25,
        country: 'Spain',
        skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Node'],
    }

    }

    /*
    * Conclusions:

    - Regular for loop can be used anywhere when the number of iteration is known.
    - While loop when the number of iteration is not know
    - Do while loop and while loop are almost the same but do while loop run at least once even when the condition is false
    - for of is used only for array
    - forEach is used for array
    - for in is used for object
